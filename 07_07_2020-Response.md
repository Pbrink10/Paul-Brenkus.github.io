1.  From the video Maroney introduced us to the world of Machine Learning. In our previous processes, we wrote
   our code and with certain rules that accounted for how the program ran. Traditional programming uses our manual
   inputs to create an output. Machine Learning on the other hand, uses an automated process to run your program 
   and inputs the information through an algorithm. For example, if we were to input customer demographics and 
   transactions, and then have historical customer churning rates as an output. Using these two characteristics,
   the algorithm will then create the program and will give you predictions (in this case) based on the data you provided.


2. -First Ouput -----> 21.999985
   -Second Output -----> 22.000015

   - The reason that these two are different is because everytime the project runs, it continuously
     optimizes and learns from itself. Whether you are running 1000 epochs or 10000 epochs, the output
     will be different because of the optimization within the algorithm itself.

   I found that the the best priced home was the 3 bedroom home which gave us a value of -1.0251. This value corresponds to the fact that
   our home is better priced according to the market. Next, our worst valued home is the 4 bedroom which had a value of 1.4911. This value could
   be an indication that we overpaid for our home.
