### 1.) When using a convolution, it gives the algorithm the ability to better perform using its neural networks. Incorporating the convolution also gives your algorithm the ability to stop overfitting or underfitting your model comapared to previous posted code. Within the convolution itself, as the picture is turned to black and white, each pixel within the image is given a number designated by how saturated or unsatured it is. For example, if you have a smaller number, the lighter it is. Once the picture has been changed, a filter is applied and to the image, which is smaller than the original image, and is extended to each individual pixel in the image itself. Once the image has been ran through the filter the image, orginally 3x3, will come out smaller, 2x2. Depending on your value in the filters the values should be equal to 0 or 1, if they are not equal to 0 or 1, then a weight should be added so that the values will reduce or increase to the desired 0 or 1. Extending over each individual pixel in the photos, the filter emphasizes certain aspects of the image depending on your photo as you will see in the following examples.
