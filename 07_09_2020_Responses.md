1.) What is TF Hub? How did you use it when creating your script for 'text classification of
    movie reviews'?
    
    Tensorflow is a library for the publication, discovery, and consumption of reusable parts of
    machine learning models. The hub lets you download and reuse them in your Tensorflow program with
    a minimum amount of code. We use the hub to install a library called 'nightly'. 
    
2.) What are the optimizer and loss functions? How good was your 'text classification of movie
    reviews' model?
    
    
    
3.) In 'text classification with preprocessed text' you produced a graph of training and validation
    loss. Add the graph to this response and provide a brief explanation. 
    
4.) Likewise do the same for the training and validation accuracy graph.
