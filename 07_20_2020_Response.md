### Problem Statement

#### For my final project I look to explore the area of sports analytics, specifically the National Hockey League (NHL). For anyone who is a hockey fan, the NHL provides you with an ultimate fan experience. An assortmant of entertaining goals, crowd enthusiasm, and of course the only major professional sport that allows fighting. In the project itself, I look to act as a team manager and create the perfect lineup based on certain variables. Some variables include: Goals, Assists, and Save percentage, but some of the more valuable variables will be based on +/- ratings, shot percentage, and 5-on-5 goals for as these are highly regarded on what a good team consists of. In terms of complexity I will need to exploit each players statistics in a way that when combined will make the perfect team and can be simulated in an 82 game season. Some potential roadblocks are expected to happen such as: evaluating the data in a way to extract only what I need and in a timely fashion, creating a simulation where biases are absent from the equation, and plan for the event where my algorithm predicts scores not accurate to what is anticipated.
